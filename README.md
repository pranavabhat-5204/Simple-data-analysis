# Simple-data-analysis

## Installations needed
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib

## Graphs included in this code
The following plots are included:

Survival Count → Overall survival distribution

Survival by Gender → Male vs Female survival rates

Survival by Class → Passenger class influence on survival

Age Distribution (KDE Plot) → Age vs survival probability

Fare Distribution (Violin Plot) → Fare differences across classes

Age vs Class & Survival (Box Plot) → Combined view of age, class, and survival

## Observations
Gender: Women had a much higher survival rate than men.

Class: First-class passengers survived more often than second and third class.

Age: Children had slightly better survival chances compared to elderly passengers.

Fare: Higher fares (wealthier passengers) correlated with higher survival.

Combination: Younger passengers in first/second class had the best survival rates.
